# Model Card

This model card describes about the income prediction model trained on census income dataset.

## Model Details
The Scikit-Learn's Random Forest model is trained on the census income dataset.
## Intended Use
This model is created to prove that it's possible to predict a person's income level (>50k, <=50k) based on just a few characteristics of the person including demographics, occupation information.

## Training Data
Census Income Dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income)

The dataset contains 48842 salary-level instances with an associated person's 14 attributes. 80% are randomly chosen to train a model

## Evaluation Data
Census Income Dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income)

The dataset contains 48842 salary-level instances with an associated person's 14 attributes. 20% are randomly chosen to test the trained model's performance.
